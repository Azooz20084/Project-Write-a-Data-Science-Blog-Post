## Project Motivation
This project aims to predict the nightly price of Airbnb listings based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and amenities. By understanding the key drivers of price, hosts can optimize their listings, and guests can better estimate the cost of staying at different properties.

## Tools & Libraries Used
The following libraries were used for data analysis and modeling:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding and analysis

## Repository Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing any dataset files used for the analysis (if applicable).
- `images/`: Directory containing images used in the analysis or blog post (if applicable).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Key Business Questions
1. **What factors most strongly influence the price of an Airbnb listing?**
   - We found that amenities such as Wi-Fi and the number of bedrooms have the highest impact on price.
2. **How does location affect the price of a listing?**
   - Listings in premium neighborhoods such as Downtown and Queen Anne tend to have significantly higher prices.
3. **What is the predicted price of a new listing based on its features?**
   - Using a machine learning model, we can estimate the price of new listings based on their characteristics.

## Summary of Results
- The linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of 0.52 on the test data.
- The most important features for predicting price were the number of bedrooms, availability of a kitchen, and certain amenities like Wi-Fi.
- Listings in premium neighborhoods were priced significantly higher, while those in suburban areas were more affordable.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the datasets provided by Airbnb and resources from StackOverflow and Kaggle that helped in completing this project.
